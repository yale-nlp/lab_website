Both ligand and target molecules are represented as graphs with node and edge features encoding information about atomic elements and bonds respectively. Although existing deep learning models perform remarkably well at predicting physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the generation of new molecules with optimized properties remains challenging. Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm. Furthermore, step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or other sequential processing can be slow and result in a high proportion of invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed in order to satisfy the principles of stoichiometry. To address these issues, we propose a representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide the latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure information with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that structure the representation also by molecular properties. We show that this highly structured latent space can be directly used for molecular graph generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate that our architecture learns meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides a platform for goal-directed drug synthesis.\",\n  authors: [\n    \"Dhananjay Bhaskar\",\n    \"Jackson Grady\",\n    \"Egbert Castro\",\n    \"Michael Perlmutter\",\n    \"Smita Krishnaswamy\"\n  ],\n  href: \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06241v1\",\n  keywords: [\n    \"Drug Discovery\",\n    \"Geometric\",\n    \"Geometric Scattering\",\n    \"Graph\",\n    \"Molecular\",\n    \"Molecular Graph Generation\",\n    \"Scattering\"\n  ],\n  month: 10,\n  periodical: \"IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, MLSP\",\n  publisher: \"IEEE Computer Society\",\n  selected: true,\n  title: \"Molecular Graph Generation via Geometric Scattering\",\n  type: \"Journal Article\",\n  year: 2021\n};\nexport {\n  data as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAK,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG;AACb,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,+6CAA+6C;AAC77C,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE;AACX,IAAI,mBAAmB;AACvB,IAAI,eAAe;AACnB,IAAI,eAAe;AACnB,IAAI,oBAAoB;AACxB,IAAI,oBAAoB;AACxB,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;AAC5C,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE;AACZ,IAAI,gBAAgB;AACpB,IAAI,WAAW;AACf,IAAI,sBAAsB;AAC1B,IAAI,OAAO;AACX,IAAI,WAAW;AACf,IAAI,4BAA4B;AAChC,IAAI,YAAY;AAChB,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;AACX,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,6EAA6E;AAC3F,EAAE,SAAS,EAAE,uBAAuB;AACpC,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;AAChB,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,qDAAqD;AAC9D,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,iBAAiB;AACzB,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;AACZ;;;;"}
