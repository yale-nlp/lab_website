His research interests are in machine learning and algorithms. Currently, he is working on optimal transport methods for single-cell data using a combination of graph and deep learning methods.\\nAlex grew up in Seattle, Washington. He completed B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Tufts University in 2017.
