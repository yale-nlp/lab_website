Data amassed from fMRI measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over time. However, analysing such data presents a challenge due to the large degree of noise and person-to-person variation in how information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we present a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features, i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust to noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that they are also useful in studying within-subject brain state trajectories of subjects performing a particular task. Here, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to a group of participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall topological activity between adults and children watching the same movie.\",\n  authors: [\n    \"Bastian Rieck\",\n    \"Tristan Yates\",\n    \"Christian Bock\",\n    \"Karsten Borgwardt\",\n    \"Guy Wolf\",\n    \"Nicholas Turk-Browne\",\n    \"Smita Krishnaswamy\"\n  ],\n  href: \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07882v2\",\n  keywords: [],\n  month: 6,\n  periodical: \"NeurIPS\",\n  publisher: \"Neural information processing systems foundation\",\n  selected: true,\n  title: \"Uncovering the Topology of Time-Varying fMRI Data using Cubical Persistence\",\n  type: \"Journal Article\",\n  year: 2020\n};\nexport {\n  data as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAK,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG;AACb,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,qsCAAqsC;AACntC,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE;AACX,IAAI,eAAe;AACnB,IAAI,eAAe;AACnB,IAAI,gBAAgB;AACpB,IAAI,mBAAmB;AACvB,IAAI,UAAU;AACd,IAAI,sBAAsB;AAC1B,IAAI,oBAAoB;AACxB,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;AAC5C,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,EAAE;AACd,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC;AACV,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,SAAS;AACvB,EAAE,SAAS,EAAE,kDAAkD;AAC/D,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;AAChB,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,6EAA6E;AACtF,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,iBAAiB;AACzB,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;AACZ;;;;"}
