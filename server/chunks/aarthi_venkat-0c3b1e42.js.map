She is interested in developing improved methods to study cancer immunogenomics. To this end, her research focuses on machine learning and graph-based methods that leverage the rich properties of single-cell RNA sequencing data.Aarthi graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics. While there, she performed resesarch in Dr. Ferhat Ay's lab, where she analyzed Hi-C sequencing data to interpret the conserved organizational features of parasite genomes. She also worked with Dr. Theresa Gaasterland to study cancer genomics and structural variation. Over the summers, Aarthi interned at Auris Health and Regeneron, where she further grew her skillset in synergistic approaches to computer science and biological discovery.\",\n  image: \"/images/members/aarthi_venkat.jpg\",\n  name: {\n    first: \"Aarthi\",\n    last: \"Venkat\",\n    preferred: \"Aarthi\"\n  },\n  name_str: \"Aarthi Venkat\",\n  publications: [\"Single-cell multi-modal GAN reveals spatial patterns in single-cell data from triple-negative breast cancer\"],\n  status: \"PhD Student\"\n};\nexport {\n  data as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAK,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG;AACb,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,y0BAAy0B;AACl1B,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,mCAAmC;AAC5C,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE;AACR,IAAI,KAAK,EAAE,QAAQ;AACnB,IAAI,IAAI,EAAE,QAAQ;AAClB,IAAI,SAAS,EAAE,QAAQ;AACvB,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,eAAe;AAC3B,EAAE,YAAY,EAAE,CAAC,6GAA6G,CAAC;AAC/H,EAAE,MAAM,EAAE,aAAa;AACvB;;;;"}
