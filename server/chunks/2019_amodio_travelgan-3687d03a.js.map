The achievements of these models have been limited to a particular subset of domains where this assumption yields good results, namely homogeneous domains that are characterized by style or texture differences. We tackle the challenging problem of image-to-image translation where the domains are defined by high-level shapes and contexts, as well as including significant clutter and heterogeneity. For this purpose, we introduce a novel GAN based on preserving intra-domain vector transformations in a latent space learned by a siamese network. The traditional GAN system introduced a discriminator network to guide the generator into generating images in the target domain. To this two-network system we add a third: a siamese network that guides the generator so that each original image shares semantics with its generated version. With this new three-network system, we no longer need to constrain the generators with the ubiquitous cycle-consistency restraint. As a result, the generators can learn mappings between more complex domains that differ from each other by large differences - not just style or texture.\",\n  authors: [\n    \"Matthew Amodio\",\n    \"Smita Krishnaswamy\"\n  ],\n  href: \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09631v1\",\n  keywords: [\n    \"Deep Learning\",\n    \"Image and Video Synthesis\",\n    \"Others\"\n  ],\n  month: 2,\n  pages: \"8975-8984\",\n  periodical: \"Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\",\n  publisher: \"IEEE Computer Society\",\n  selected: true,\n  title: \"TraVeLGAN: Image-to-image Translation by Transformation Vector Learning\",\n  type: \"Journal Article\",\n  year: 2019\n};\nexport {\n  data as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"AAAK,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG;AACb,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,qwCAAqwC;AACnxC,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE;AACX,IAAI,gBAAgB;AACpB,IAAI,oBAAoB;AACxB,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,oCAAoC;AAC5C,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE;AACZ,IAAI,eAAe;AACnB,IAAI,2BAA2B;AAC/B,IAAI,QAAQ;AACZ,GAAG;AACH,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC;AACV,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,WAAW;AACpB,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,gGAAgG;AAC9G,EAAE,SAAS,EAAE,uBAAuB;AACpC,EAAE,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;AAChB,EAAE,KAAK,EAAE,yEAAyE;AAClF,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,iBAAiB;AACzB,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;AACZ;;;;"}
