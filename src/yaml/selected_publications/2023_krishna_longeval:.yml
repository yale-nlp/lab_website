abstract: "While human evaluation remains best practice for accurately judging the\
  \ faithfulness of automatically-generated summaries, few solutions exist to address\
  \ the increased difficulty and workload when evaluating long-form summaries. Through\
  \ a survey of 162 papers on long-form summarization, we first shed light on current\
  \ human evaluation practices surrounding long-form summaries. We find that 73% of\
  \ these papers do not perform any human evaluation on model-generated summaries,\
  \ while other works face new difficulties that manifest when dealing with long documents\
  \ (e.g., low inter-annotator agreement). Motivated by our survey, we present LongEval,\
  \ a set of guidelines for human evaluation of faithfulness in long-form summaries\
  \ that addresses the following challenges: (1) How can we achieve high inter-annotator\
  \ agreement on faithfulness scores? (2) How can we minimize annotator workload while\
  \ maintaining accurate faithfulness scores? and (3) Do humans benefit from automated\
  \ alignment between summary and source snippets? We deploy LongEval in annotation\
  \ studies on two long-form summarization datasets in different domains (SQuALITY\
  \ and PubMed), and we find that switching to a finer granularity of judgment (e.g.,\
  \ clause-level) reduces inter-annotator variance in faithfulness scores (e.g., std-dev\
  \ from 18.5 to 6.8). We also show that scores from a partial annotation of fine-grained\
  \ units highly correlates with scores from a full annotation workload (0.89 Kendall\u2019\
  s tau using 50% judgements). We release our human judgments, annotation templates,\
  \ and software as a Python library for future research."
