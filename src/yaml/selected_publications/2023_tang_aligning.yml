abstract: 'In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, accurate and concise
  summarization of clinical studies is crucial to support evidence-based practice.
  This paper presents a novel approach to clinical studies summarization, leveraging
  reinforcement learning to enhance factual consistency and align with human annotator
  preferences. Our work focuses on two tasks: Conclusion Generation and Review Generation.
  We train a CONFIT summarization model that outperforms GPT-3 and previous state-of-the-art
  models on the same datasets and collects expert and crowd-worker annotations to
  evaluate the quality and factual consistency of the generated summaries. These annotations
  enable us to measure the correlation of various automatic metrics, including modern
  factual evaluation metrics like QAFactEval, with human-assessed factual consistency.
  By employing top-correlated metrics as objectives for a reinforcement learning model,
  we demonstrate improved factuality in generated summaries that are preferred by
  human annotators.'
