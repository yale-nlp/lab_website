abstract: The volume of scientific output is creating an urgent need for automated
  tools to help scientists keep up with developments in their field. Semantic Scholar
  (S2) is an open data platform and website aimed at accelerating science by helping
  scholars discover and understand scientific literature. We combine public and proprietary
  data sources using state-of-theart techniques for scholarly PDF content extraction
  and automatic knowledge graph construction to build the Semantic Scholar Academic
  Graph, the largest open scientific literature graph to-date, with 200M+ papers,
  80M+ authors, 550M+ paper-authorship edges, and 2.4B+ citation edges. The graph
  includes advanced semantic features such as structurally parsed text, natural language
  summaries, and vector embeddings. In this paper, we describe the components of the
  S2 data processing pipeline and the associated APIs offered by the platform. We
  will update this living document to reflect changes as we add new data offerings
  and improve existing services.
