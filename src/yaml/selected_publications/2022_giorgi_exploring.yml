abstract: 'Multi-document summarization (MDS) traditionally assumes a set of topic-related
  documents are provided. However, this document set is often an artifact of the dataset
  curation process; in practice, it is not necessarily available and would need to
  be retrieved given an information need, i.e. a question or topic statement. We study
  this more challenging"open-domain"setting by formalizing the task and bootstrapping
  it using existing datasets, retrievers and summarizers. Via extensive experimentation,
  we determine that: (1) state-of-the-art summarizers suffer large reductions in performance
  when applied to the open-domain, even when retrieval performance is high, (2) additional
  training in the open-domain setting can reduce this sensitivity to imperfect retrieval,
  and (3) summarizers are insensitive to the retrieval of duplicate documents and
  the order of retrieved documents, but highly sensitive to other errors, like the
  retrieval of irrelevant documents. Based on our results, we provide practical guidelines
  to enable future work on open-domain MDS, e.g. how to choose the number of retrieved
  documents to summarize. Our results suggest that new methods for retrieval and summarization,
  as well as annotated resources for training and evaluation, will be necessary for
  further progress in the open-domain.'
