abstract: "We propose a simple yet effective model, D OC - 001 H OPPER , for selecting\
  \ evidence from long 002 structured documents to answer complex ques- 003 tions.\
  \ Similar to multi-hop question-answering 004 (QA) systems, at each step, D OC H\
  \ OPPER it- 005 eratively uses a query q to extract information 006 from a document,\
  \ and combines this informa- 007 tion with q to produce the next query. How- 008\
  \ ever, in contrast to most previous multi-hop 009 QA systems, D OC H OPPER is able\
  \ to extract 010 either short or long sections of the document, 011 thus emulating\
  \ a multi-step process of \u201Cnavi- 012 gating\u201D through a long document to\
  \ answer a 013 question. To enable this novel behavior, D OC - 014 H OPPER does\
  \ not combine document informa- 015 tion with q by concatenating text to the text\
  \ of 016 q , but by combining a compact neural represen- 017 tation of q with a\
  \ compact neural representation 018 of a (potentially large) hierarchical part of\
  \ the 019 document. We evaluate D OC H OPPER on three 020 different tasks that require\
  \ reading long struc- 021 tured documents and finding multiple pieces of 022 evidence,\
  \ and show D OC H OPPER outperforms 023 Transformer models for plain text input.\
  \ Addi- 024 tionally, D OC H OPPER is efficient at inference 025 time, being 10\u2013\
  250 times faster than baselines. 026"
