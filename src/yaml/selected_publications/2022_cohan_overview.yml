abstract: 'With the ever-increasing pace of research and high volume of scholarly
  communication, scholars face a daunting task. Not only must they keep up with the
  growing literature in their own and related fields, scholars increasingly also need
  to rebut pseudo-science and disinformation. These needs have motivated an increasing
  focus on computational methods for enhancing search, summarization, and analysis
  of scholarly documents. However, the various strands of research on scholarly document
  processing remain fragmented. To reach out to the broader NLP and AI/ML community,
  pool distributed efforts in this area, and enable shared access to published research,
  we held the 3rd Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) at COLING as a hybrid
  event (https://sdproc.org/2022/). The SDP workshop consisted of a research track,
  three invited talks and five Shared Tasks: 1) MSLR22: Multi-Document Summarization
  for Literature Reviews, 2) DAGPap22: Detecting automatically generated scientific
  papers, 3) SV-Ident 2022: Survey Variable Identification in Social Science Publications,
  4) SKGG: Scholarly Knowledge Graph Generation, 5) MuP 2022: Multi Perspective Scientific
  Document Summarization. The program was geared towards NLP, information retrieval,
  and data mining for scholarly documents, with an emphasis on identifying and providing
  solutions to open challenges.'
