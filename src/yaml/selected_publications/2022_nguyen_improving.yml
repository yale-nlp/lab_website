abstract: "Automated methods have been widely used to identify and analyze mental\
  \ health conditions (e.g., depression) from various sources of information, including\
  \ social media. Yet, deployment of such models in real-world healthcare applications\
  \ faces challenges including poor out-of-domain generalization and lack of trust\
  \ in black box models. In this work, we propose approaches for depression detection\
  \ that are constrained to different degrees by the presence of symptoms described\
  \ in PHQ9, a questionnaire used by clinicians in the depression screening process.\
  \ In dataset-transfer experiments on three social media datasets, we find that grounding\
  \ the model in PHQ9\u2019s symptoms substantially improves its ability to generalize\
  \ to out-of-distribution data compared to a standard BERT-based approach. Furthermore,\
  \ this approach can still perform competitively on in-domain data. These results\
  \ and our qualitative analyses suggest that grounding model predictions in clinically-relevant\
  \ symptoms can improve generalizability while producing a model that is easier to\
  \ inspect."
